# ACACES2022 Slides

This repository contains the slides used during the ACACES 2022 summer
school, organized by https://www.HiPEAC.net

* Monday 11 July
  * [Introduction Slides / Course presentation](2022-07-ACACES-HP-Charles-Intro.pdf)
  * [1st course Hardware evolution](2022-07-ACACES-HP-Charles-J1.pdf)

    * This course give architecture evolution examples which explains
      why it is so difficult to reach peak hardware performance in an
      application

  * [2nd course Compiler evolution high level view](2022-07-ACACES-HP-Charles-J2.pdf)
    * This course give a state of the art in classical compiler
      strategy for compiling code: static with gcc and llvm and more
      dynamic for Java & Javascript


  * [3rd course Compiler strange example usage](2022-07-ACACES-HP-Charles-J3.pdf)

    * This course give example of small applications with
    automodifications capabilities. The code responsible for this
    automodification capabilities is a "compilette". A "compilette" is a
    parametric code generator embedded into an application whih helps
    to adapt the running code to a changing context. Examples containt:


      * A simple addition with a number known at running time
      * A more complex example using Newton algorithm with
        transprecision example from fp 32 to fp 64
      * A more complex example showing how to program a computing in
        memory architecture CxRAM
    
  * [4rd course How to build a compiler](2022-07-ACACES-HP-Charles-J4.pdf)

    * This course explains the technologies used in the HybroGen
      compilation chain
